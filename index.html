  <u>ABOUT US</u><br>
  <p>In trinity catholic college we educate students to fulfill their potentials.
  Trinity's tradition of independent intellectual inquiry has produced some of the world's finest, most original minds including the writers Oscar Wilde and Samuel Beckett (Nobel laureate), the scientists William Rowan Hamilton and Ernest Walton (Nobel laureate), the political thinker Edmund Burke.
  At Trinity College, we're known for getting things done—and for doing them in a way that creates lasting meaning. Students come here to engage in a challenging liberal arts education, live as part of a tenacious community, explore what's possible, and find answers to the challenges of tomorrow.
